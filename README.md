# Airbnb Data Mining Project Pricing Segmentation Analysis
A data mining-driven analysis of Airbnb listings to uncover pricing drivers and segment listings into Budget, Mid-Tier, and Luxury tiers

## ‚ö° TL;DR (Project Summary)

- Explored 3,982 Airbnb listings to uncover pricing patterns using EDA, statistical analysis, and explainable ML.
- Identified **property type**, **season**, and **number of bedrooms** as top predictors of price.

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes the **pricing dynamics of Airbnb listings** in a major metropolitan area using statistical inference, explainable machine learning, and segmentation techniques. The goal is to support **consumer-tier segmentation** and **conditional pricing strategies** ‚Äî not to build black-box models, but to derive actionable insights for stakeholders like hosts, travelers, and platform managers.

## üéØ Business Objectives

- Identify **key factors** that drive nightly pricing for Airbnb listings.
- Analyze **interactions** (e.g., season √ó property type) using statistical tests and explainable ML.
- Segment listings into **Budget**, **Mid-Tier**, and **Luxury** tiers using clustering.
- Translate statistical significance into **practical recommendations** for pricing optimization.

## üìä Data Summary & Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: `Airbnb_df.csv`, 3,982 listings, 15 features including:
  - Property attributes (type, bedrooms, amenities, etc.)
  - Host data (response time, experience)
  - Pricing info (nightly rate, cleaning fee)
- **Use Case**: Price optimization, customer segmentation, and actionable listing insights.

### üîç Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Dropped `listing_id` (identifier) and log-transformed `nightly_rate` (target).
- **Skewed variables** (`years_as_host`, `cleaning_fee`) transformed or capped.
- Addressed **multicollinearity** (removed `guest_capacity` due to high VIF).
- Standardized numerical variables before modeling and clustering.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Insights

- Nightly rate and cleaning fee are **right-skewed**. 
- Right-skewed distributions justify log transformation for modeling

  <br>
  <em>Figure 1. Distribution of Nightly Rate and Cleaning Fee </em>
</p  

- Most listings:
  - Are 1‚Äì2 bedroom apartments
  - Charge <$300 per night
  - Have positive reviews and location scores

### Bivariate/Multivariate Insights

- **Guest capacity √ó Season**: Higher capacity drives up price, especially in peak season.

- **Review and location scores**: Have weaker individual impact but amplify with seasonal or spatial context.
- Detected **non-linear trends** ‚Äî motivating the use of both linear and tree-based models.
-  Figure 2 shows multicollinearity between `bedrooms`, `guest_capacity`, and `cleaning_fee`.

## üîç Predictive Modeling

### üîπ Linear Regression (Inference-Focused)

- **Final model features**: `property_type`, `season`, `number_of_bedrooms`, `location_score`
- Achieved:
  - R¬≤ = 0.379 (test)
  - MAE ‚âà $63
- Passed assumptions: homoscedasticity, normality, low multicollinearity

#### Key Coefficients (Interpreted in Dollars):

| Feature              | Impact    |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Standard Apartment   | -$61      |
| Tiny Studio          | -$80      |
| Peak Season          | +$89      |
| Shoulder Season      | +$34      |
| +1 SD in bedrooms    | +$24      |
| +1 SD in location score | +$8   |

### üîπ Decision Tree (Interpretability-Focused)

- R¬≤ = 0.359, MAE ‚âà $70
- Easy-to-follow pricing rules:
  - If `season = peak` and `bedrooms > 2.5`, price ‚âà $278‚Äì$350
  - If `bedrooms ‚â§ 2.5` and off-season, price ‚âà $117

| 1       | **Budget**  | Low scores, smaller size, lowest prices         |
| 0       | **Mid-Tier**| Balanced price, great reviews, fewer amenities  |

## üìå Key Takeaways

- **Property type**, **season**, and **bedroom count** are the most reliable predictors of price.
- **Linear model** helps infer monetary impact; **decision tree** helps segment and apply pricing rules.
